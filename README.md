### `Description`
This application is an employee directory application used to view the entire list of employees. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. The user has the option to search by name or sort names in ascending or descending order when searching for an employee. This application has been created using React. The application's UI has been broken down into components that are managed using state while responding to user events.
